    <p>Below a member's name, you may see the words 'Puppies,' 'Stud Dog,' 'Information,' etc. Please note that this is a voluntary feature of our membership list and some members listed will not have this information. Below is an explanation:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Puppies - This is if the member is a breeder of Pembroke Welsh Corgis, and occasionally has litters. This does not guarantee they will currently have a litter on the ground. The GGPWCF has a "Public Outreach Committee" that will help those looking for a PWC find a member breeder. If you are looking for a PWC puppy or adult and would like a breeder referral, please contact the members listed below, or Email: ggpwcfoutreach@gmail.com</li>
      <li>Stud Dog - Availability; call member for more information.</li>
      <li>Information - These are our members that are available to provide prospective or current PWC owners with information about the breed, activities and training advice.</li>
